Pros if being talkative are obvious. The first thing that needs to be said
is that talkative person is social in other words it is easier to
communicate to him and work as a team. Talkative person will not feel shy in group of people and
it could help him to be a good negotiator. Also people feel
themselves more comfortable in presence of a talkative person.
