There are less drawbacks of being talkative than pros.
One of the bad sides of being talkative is that sometimes it could be inappropriate, 
for instance during classes. Also being talkative can be annoying, 
because in some cases people don't want to talk,
nevertheless they try to continue the dialogue.
And the last, it can disturb someone from doing his work.
