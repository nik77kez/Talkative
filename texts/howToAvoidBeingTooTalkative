Read social cues – look if the person you’re speaking with is interested in what you’re saying or are they annoyed by you?
Ask questions and try to get person's personal opinion about things, because it makes your companion
more interested in the dialogue. Put yourself in their shoes, try to think would this topic be interesting
for you if you were on opponent's place. Avoid presonal reference overflow such as "I", "Me", "My", because your
opinion or expirience may be tedious for someone and that can make them feel like they are wasting their time, 
talking to you.
