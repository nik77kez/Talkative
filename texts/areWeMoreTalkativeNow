Are we more talkative now than we were in the beginning of the year?
Apparently we became more talkative since we know each other better now and
we feel less uncomfortable talking to each other. We don't feel
bashful anymore and the topics of our dialogues has broaden,
because now we know each others' interests and personal information.
It is way more interesting and comfortable to speak to the person
you know.
